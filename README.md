# REACT E-commerce🛒

## Description👨‍🏫

Built with MERN stack. Overall, the app offers the possibility to perform these actions: 

1. Merchants manage their own brand component
2. Buyers browse the store categories, products and brands
3. Administrators manage and control the entire store components 


* Features👨‍🔬\
  some major features are:
  * Node provides the backend environment for the whole app
  * Express middleware is used to handle requests and routes
  * Mongoose schemas are use to model the application data
  * React for displaying User Interface components
  * Redux to manage application's state
  * Redux Thunk middleware to handle asynchronous redux actions
  * Webpack the module bundler. Optimize the weight of our source code and thus contribute to the good app performance
  * Chalk to beautify the console's response
  * Redux to manage application's state
  * Passport for authentication
  * AWS-SDK simpliﬁes use of AWS Services by providing a set of libraries
  * Axios makes it easy to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints and perform CRUD operations
  * Mobile-Detect will detect the device by comparing patterns against a given User-Agent string
  * Tsscmp prevents timing attacks using Brad Hill's Double HMAC pattern to perform secure string comparison
